# hello-world
rite of passage

Hey, I'm Flo, I'm a Physics and Computer Science student at ETH looking into Quantum Information Processing and Artificial Intelligence. Since last summer I'm a big time tennis fan, I like to play football and video games and am into space exploration and politics. 

Also a fan of Yuval Noah Harari, Elon Musk and the blog Wait-But-Why
